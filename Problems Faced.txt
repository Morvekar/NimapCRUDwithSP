Created a MVC .Net project using Stored Procedures


Created four stored procedures for Insert, Update, Delete and Display queries

Used Inner Join to joined two tables in the sql queries where ever required

Only Views are created manually rest i have written the codes and not used Scafolding

Update, Delete, Display are working perfectly fine and also i have added the pagination.
For pagination I have installed two packegs related to pagination 
and added the pagelist tag in the List.html file

Issue: When inserting the data the CustomerID is not retrived by the Stored Procedure
	I tried solving it and can do it if i continue to find the issue till then
	I have submitted the latest file
